# MyReads Project



https://tenacious-g.github.io/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/



This project is part of Google Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree course and allows a user to sort a small library of books into three sections depending on whether the user is currently reading, wants to read, or already has read, a particular book.

The student was given a  [Starting template](https://github.com/Tenacious-G/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/template-contents.md) with static HTML and CSS mark-up and had to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template. Good React design practice was followed by creating new JS files for each component and using import/require statements to include them where needed.



These are the methods used by the [Backend Server API](https://github.com/Tenacious-G/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/backend-server.md). It uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Drunken Weavers or Bubble Blowing don't come back with any results.
